## Introduction
The Image Forgery Detection System is an academic project designed to identify tampered or forged images using Error Level Analysis (ELA) and Machine Learning. The system combines a Python-based frontend with a backend powered by a robust machine learning model to provide high-accuracy forgery detection.

## Features
- **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**: Detects discrepancies in image compression levels to identify possible tampering.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained model to enhance detection accuracy.
- **User-friendly Frontend**: Built with Python, providing an intuitive interface for users to upload and analyze images.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves reliable and precise forgery detection results.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frontend**: Python-based interface
- **Backend**: Python with Machine Learning model
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-forgery-detection.git
   cd image-forgery-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pre-trained Model**:
   - Place the pre-trained machine learning model in the `model` directory.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Upload an Image**: Use the frontend interface to upload the image you want to analyze.
2. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze" button to perform Error Level Analysis and check for possible forgeries.
3. **Results**: View the results indicating whether the image is likely to be forged or authentic, along with the confidence level.
